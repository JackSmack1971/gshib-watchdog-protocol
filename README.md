## ‚ú® Enhanced Architecture Overview

The GuardianShib Enhanced Protocol consists of **five core smart contracts**:

### üèõÔ∏è **Governance Layer**
1. **`EnhancedGSHIBToken.sol`** ‚Äî Governance-enabled ERC20 token with voting capabilities
2. **`GuardianShibTimelock.sol`** ‚Äî Timelock controller for delayed execution of governance decisions
3. **`GSHIBGovernor.sol`** ‚Äî Decentralized governance contract for community voting

### üîß **Protocol Layer**
